## Genotype-Phenotype Associations

- [Probing the genomic limits of de-extinction in the Christmas Island rat](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35271794/)
  
   This paper examines the feasibility of de-extinction using the Christmas Island    rat (Rattus macleari) by mapping its genome to 
   the Norway brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Despite recovering 95% of the genome, key genes related to immune response (MHC class I, 
   MAGEB18), olfaction (Vomeronasal receptor genes - Vom2r), and non-coding RNAs (snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA) were either incomplete or 
   entirely absent. The findings highlight that evolutionary divergence limits the accuracy of genome reconstruction, affecting 
  traits critical for survival.

- **[Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24277)**

  The GTEx project studies how genetic variation influences gene expression in 44 human tissues. Most genes are affected by local genetic variation, and some have inter-chromosomal effects. The study explores tissue-specific expression, genetic regulation, and disease-associated genes, providing insights into gene regulation and disease mechanisms.


- **[Genetic basis of ecologically relevant body shape variation among four genera of cichlid fishe](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mec.16977)**

  The study identifies 34 QTLs affecting body shape variations in cichlid fishes from East African Rift Lakes, revealing distinct genetic mechanisms.


- **[From GWAS to signal validation: An approach for estimating genetic effects while preserving genomic context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10028994/)**

   New method validates SNP-level genotype-phenotype associations in outbred populations using synthetic crosses, tested on Drosophila for longevity impacts of a natural cis-eQTL.


- **[Heterogeneity of genetic architecture of body size traits in a free-living population](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13146)**
  
  The study investigates the genetic architecture of body size traits in a free-living population of Soay sheep using 37,037 SNPs. It finds that jaw and weight exhibit polygenic inheritance, while leg length is influenced by two major SNPs. It also suggests that alleles for shorter legs entered the population through historical admixture.


- **[Providing biological context for GWAS results using eQTL regulatory and co-expression networks in Populus](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.20026)**
 
  This study integrates GWAS, eQTL analysis, and co-expression networks to provide biological context for trait-associated loci in Populus trichocarpa. It identifies three candidate genes involved in lignocellulose biosynthesis, including Potri.005G116800/VND1 (a key regulator of secondary cell wall formation) and two novel candidates. This approach offers a framework for uncovering gene function and regulatory networks in tree species. 

- **[Polygenic basis for adaptive morphological variation in a threatened Aotearoa | New Zealand bird, the hihi (Notiomystis cincta)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.0948)**
  
   This study examines the genetic basis of three adaptive morphological traits in the threatened New Zealand bird Notiomystis cincta. Using 523 individuals and 39,699 SNPs, it finds that the traits have low heritability and a polygenic basis, with many small-effect loci contributing to trait variation. GWAS suggests that a locus in HEY2 may be associated with tarsus length. Due to the species’ small population size and polygenic inheritance, its ability to adapt to selection is likely constrained.


- **[Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Phenotypic Traits Subject to a Range of Intensities of Natural Selection in Timema cristinae](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/675497?casa_token=PMHeQg24764AAAAA%3AwTrtIkO8vMhxbEz1hxjbZiWldsdN6BuSUD2M9zVR2kaI7aOHDcULs408IWNaqSq52wrE8cD6SGvG)**

  This study examines the genetic architecture of adaptive traits under different selection intensities in Timema cristinae. Using GWAS with 211,004 SNPs and measurements of 10 phenotypic traits, it finds that some SNPs significantly contribute to trait variation. Both major and minor effect loci are identified, but no direct correlation is found between trait divergence in nature and their genetic architecture. This research is a first step in identifying loci associated with adaptation in T. cristinae, with future studies focusing on population differentiation and selection response of these SNPs.



- **[Independent and Joint-GWAS for growth traits in Eucalyptus by
assembling genome-wide data for 3373 individuals across four
breeding populations](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/nph.15449)**
  
  This study conducted independent and joint-GWAS on 3373 Eucalyptus individuals across four breeding populations, using multiple models to identify genetic associations with growth traits. While single-SNP GWAS had limited power, gene-based Joint-GWAS identified nine significant genes related to tree height. Whole-genome regression captured 64-89% of the pedigree-based heritability. The study also validated associations in forest trees and identified key genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and lignification. These results suggest that Joint-GWAS can improve tree breeding by identifying useful genetic markers.



- **[The Genetic Architecture of Maize Flowering Time](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1174276)**

    Maize flowering time is controlled by many small-effect QTLs rather than a single large-effect locus. A study of 5000 inbred lines across eight environments found that allelic effects vary among founder lines, with no major epistasis or environmental interactions. A simple additive model effectively predicts flowering time, differing from the genetic architecture of rice and Arabidopsis.



- **[Combining genome-wide association study and FST-based approaches to identify targets of Borrelia-mediated selection in natural rodent hosts](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.15410?casa_token=iyeRaaHD4LYAAAAA%3AknCigP3eDxMeEHERMfzIK-4qChD5wtjcr0vi_J4NVeVEG7sFCgRHGgfhpR54rpkokfrIaVbeNzaXyzA)**
  
  - **Study Organism：** Myodes glareolus (bank vole, a natural rodent host of Borrelia afzelii)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study combines GWAS and FST-based methods to identify genomic regions associated with Borrelia afzelii resistance or susceptibility in Myodes glareolus, a natural rodent host of the Lyme disease-causing spirochete. Using SNP data from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), four key genes (Slc26a4, Tns3, Wscd1, and Espnl) were identified as significantly associated with Borrelia infection status. These genes have known immune-related functions in rodents, making them promising candidates for studying host adaptation to bacterial infections. The approach used here is applicable to other wildlife populations for identifying genetic variants underlying disease resistance and other ecologically relevant traits.


- **[Combining paired analytical metabolomics and common garden trial to study the metabolism and gene variation of Ginkgo biloba L. cultivated varieties](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c7ra06229j)**
  - **Keywords:** metabolomics, SNP variation, flavonoid biosynthesis, genetic variation, phenotype-genotype association, artificial breeding
  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** SNP variation vs Flavonoid biosynthesis rate
  - **Study Organism：** Ginkgo biloba (maidenhair tree)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study integrates metabolomics and a common garden trial to explore genetic variation in flavonoid biosynthesis among 30 cultivated Ginkgo biloba varieties. Using UHPLC-QQQ MS/MS, 36 metabolites were quantified, linking SNP variation in enzyme-related genes to metabolic differences. Findings indicate that genetic polymorphisms influence flavonoid synthesis, although heritability is subtle. This method provides an accurate, low-sample, and efficient approach for phenotype-genotype association studies and is applicable to artificial breeding assessments.

- **[Aphid wing dimorphisms: linking environmental and genetic control of trait variation](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2009.0255)**
  - **Keywords:** aphids, wing dimorphism, phenotypic plasticity, genetic polymorphism, environmental cues, molecular mechanisms
  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** Genetic polymorphism vs Wing dimorphism
  - **Study Organism：** Aphids (various species)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study reviews the molecular mechanisms underlying aphid wing dimorphism, where wing formation is controlled by either genetic or environmental factors. Some aphid species alternate between polyphenic (environmental) and polymorphic (genetic) wing determination in their life cycle. Understanding genetically controlled polymorphisms may provide insight into the molecular basis of polyphenic variation and facilitate comparisons between genetic and environmental control mechanisms of similar traits.

- **[Divergent Allometric Trajectories in Gene Expression and Coexpression Produce Species Differences in Sympatrically Speciating Midas Cichlid Fish](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/11/6/1644/5498148)**
  - **Keywords:**  RNA-Seq, coexpression, WGCNA, benthic-limnetic divergence, evolvability, gene modules
  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** Gene coexpression vs Morphogenetic divergence (benthic vs limnetic forms)
  - **Study Organism：** Midas cichlid (Amphilophus species)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study investigates gene expression and coexpression differences in sympatrically speciating Midas cichlid fish using RNA-Seq. By analyzing two developmental stages, it identifies coexpression gene modules that differ between benthic and limnetic forms. The results indicate that gene coexpression divergence starts as early as one day post-hatch and becomes more pronounced as the fish grow. This study highlights the role of coexpressed gene networks, rather than single genes, in driving morphological divergence between ecotypes.
