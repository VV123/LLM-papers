- [Probing the genomic limits of de-extinction in the Christmas Island rat](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35271794/)
  
   This paper examines the feasibility of de-extinction using the Christmas Island    rat (Rattus macleari) by mapping its genome to 
   the Norway brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Despite recovering 95% of the genome, key genes related to immune response (MHC class I, 
   MAGEB18), olfaction (Vomeronasal receptor genes - Vom2r), and non-coding RNAs (snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA) were either incomplete or 
   entirely absent. The findings highlight that evolutionary divergence limits the accuracy of genome reconstruction, affecting 
  traits critical for survival

  - **Keywords:** polygenic inheritance, morphological adaptation, SNP heritability, genome-wide association study (GWAS), conservation genetics, Notiomystis cincta
  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** SNP variation vs Morphological traits (tarsus length, body mass, head-bill length)
  - **Study Organism：** Notiomystis cincta (Hihi, a threatened New Zealand bird)

assembling genome-wide data for 3373 individuals across four
breeding populations](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/nph.15449)**

  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** SNP variation vs Growth traits (tree height, cell wall biosynthesis, lignification)
  - **Study Organism：** Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus species)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study conducted independent and joint-GWAS on 3373 Eucalyptus individuals across four breeding populations, using multiple models to identify genetic associations with growth traits. While single-SNP GWAS had limited power, gene-based Joint-GWAS identified nine significant genes related to tree height. Whole-genome regression captured 64-89% of the pedigree-based heritability. The study also validated associations in forest trees and identified key genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and lignification. These results suggest that Joint-GWAS can improve tree breeding by identifying useful genetic markers.

- **[The Genetic Architecture of Maize Flowering Time](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1174276)**
  - **Keywords:**  flowering time, maize, quantitative trait loci (QTL), genetic architecture, additive model, NAM population
  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** QTL variation vs Flowering time
  - **Study Organism：** Zea mays (maize/corn)

A study of 5000 inbred lines across eight environments found that allelic effects vary among founder lines, with no major epistasis or environmental interactions. A simple additive model effectively predicts flowering time, differing from the genetic architecture of rice and Arabidopsis.

  - **Study Organism：** Myodes glareolus (bank vole, a natural rodent host of Borrelia afzelii)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study combines GWAS and FST-based methods to identify genomic regions associated with Borrelia afzelii resistance or susceptibility in Myodes glareolus, a natural rodent host of the Lyme disease-causing spirochete. Using SNP data from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), four key genes (Slc26a4, Tns3, Wscd1, and Espnl) were identified as significantly associated with Borrelia infection status. These genes have known immune-related functions in rodents, making them promising candidates for studying host adaptation to bacterial infections. The approach used here is applicable to other wildlife populations for identifying genetic variants underlying disease resistance and other ecologically relevant traits.

  - **Keywords:**  RNA-Seq, coexpression, WGCNA, benthic-limnetic divergence, evolvability, gene modules
  - **Genotype vs Phenotype:** Gene coexpression vs Morphogenetic divergence (benthic vs limnetic forms)
  - **Study Organism：** Midas cichlid (Amphilophus species)
  - **Paper Summary:** This study investigates gene expression and coexpression differences in sympatrically speciating Midas cichlid fish using RNA-Seq. By analyzing two developmental stages, it identifies coexpression gene modules that differ between benthic and limnetic forms. The results indicate that gene coexpression divergence starts as early as one day post-hatch and becomes more pronounced as the fish grow. This study highlights the role of coexpressed gene networks, rather than single genes, in driving morphological divergence between ecotypes.
