  (short description of the paper using 2-3 sentences) This paper examines the feasibility of de-extinction using the Christmas Island    rat (Rattus macleari) by mapping its genome to the Norway brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Despite recovering 95% of the genome, key 
   genes related to immune response (MHC class I, MAGEB18), olfaction (Vomeronasal receptor genes - Vom2r), and non-coding RNAs (snRNA, 
   snoRNA, tRNA) were either incomplete or entirely absent. The findings highlight that evolutionary divergence limits the accuracy of 
   genome reconstruction, affecting traits critical for survival
