- (Example) [Probing the genomic limits of de-extinction in the Christmas Island rat](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35271794/)
  
  (short description of the paper using 2-3 sentences) This paper examines the feasibility of de-extinction using the Christmas Island   
   rat (Rattus macleari) by mapping its genome to the Norway brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Despite recovering 95% of the genome, key 
   genes related to immune response (MHC class I, MAGEB18), olfaction (Vomeronasal receptor genes - Vom2r), and non-coding RNAs (snRNA, 
   snoRNA, tRNA) were either incomplete or entirely absent. The findings highlight that evolutionary divergence limits the accuracy of 
   genome reconstruction, affecting traits critical for survival
